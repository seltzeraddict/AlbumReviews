				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; Clocking in at 25 minutes and 38 seconds, <a href="https://avecplaisir.bandcamp.com/album/an-album" target="_blank"><em>"An Album"</em></a> is barely an album in length, but <em>Avec Plaisir's</em> first LP carries enough energy in its 10 short songs to earn the title. Fans of <a href="https://sport.bandcamp.com/album/slow" target="_blank"><em>Sport</em></a>, <a href="https://ifeelfine.bandcamp.com/album/the-cold-in-every-shelter" target="_blank"><em>I Feel Fine</em></a> and <a href="https://chinesefootball.bandcamp.com/album/chinese-football"><em>Chinese Football</em></a> will likely enjoy <em>Avec Plaisir</em> as well, but anyone who likes noodly riffs and gang vocals should give this a listen.</p>
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; <em>Avec Plaisir</em> gives the listener a purposeful intro track that blends smoothly into track two - aptly named <em>"Junction Before Jarry St."</em> and <em>"Jarry St."</em> The latter drives us down a road of playfully observational midwest emo, despite the four-piece band's location in the middle of Montreal. With a nod to their local language, the French name <em>Avec Plaisir</em> translates to "With Pleasure" in English. Notably, the band sings entirely in English despite their name and location.</p> 
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; My favorite song on the album might be <em>"Jujube"</em>. This is a love song for a pet dog, a fluffy white samoyed with shaggy feet which drags snow into the house every winter. It's a ballad to a best friend, and slows the listener down one last time before the album goes out with a bang in the form of <em>"Jambalaya"</em>. This album warms the heart on a cold Montreal winter day - and for recommended listening, start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbv0wXN_Bjk">the music video for the <em>Jarry St.</em> intro track</a> to set the scene in your head, and then listen to the whole album from front to back. Enjoy! :]</p>

				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp;<em><a href="https://deltasleep.bandcamp.com/album/ghost-city">"Ghost City"</a>,</em> <em>Delta Sleep's</em> second record, is an expertly crafted concept album. We find the record's protagonist staring at the concrete walls of her over-industrialized city, longing for the soft sounds of nature somewhere beyond the city's edge. Her story is told through lead singer Devin Yüceil's lyrics, while tasteful gang vocals and dynamic music elements add to the sense of scale that Delta Sleep builds throughout this album. <em>"Ghost City"</em> is another front-to-back classic and has huge replay value in my book.</p>
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; The protagonist's angst becomes clear as Yüceil's strained voice yells <i>"I'd give my whole world to find a way out!"</i> in track two, <em>"After Dark"</em>. And while the guitar parts of <em>"Ghost City"</em> are less aggressively mathy than in <em>Delta Sleep's</em> first album, this record still maintains the band's unmistakeable style within the genrescape. It can be hard to tell where one song starts and another begins, and the whole record breathes in and out with well-placed interludes and crescendos. <em>Delta Sleep's</em> math flavor is more approachable than <a href="https://invalids.bandcamp.com"><em>Invalids</em></a>, but still heavier than our old friends <a href="https://clevergirl.bandcamp.com/"><em>Clever Girl</em></a>.
				</p>
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; Lyrics like <i>"It's so hard to focus when the city watches everything you do"</i> paint a picture of a dystopian hellscape where citizens' every movement is tracked and every thought is monitored. At least we can take solace knowing that governments in reality would never enact such far-reaching surveillance on their own residents <em>(cough cough).</em> The tone shifts later in the album, where songs like <em>"El Pastor"</em> bring more uplifting music and vocals, instilling a sense of hope in the listener while moving the album's story forward. Our protagonist trudges on. </p>
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; This album feels like an old best friend who moved out of state - we may not see each other often these days, but when we do it's easy to pick up right where we left off. <em>"Ghost City"</em> is as emotional as it is technical, mirroring the complexities of modern life and reminding us that it's okay to close your computer and run into the woods for a while. With any luck, we will all escape The City and find home, again.</p>

				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; Welcome to <a href="https://clevergirl.bandcamp.com/album/no-drum-and-bass-in-the-jazz-room" target="_blank"> <em>“No Drum and Bass in the Jazz Room”</em></a>, the perfect four-track EP. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/clevergirllovesyou" target="_blank"><em>Clever Girl</em></a> was a jazzy math rock band that released this one album before breaking up, but the band's ephemeral nature combined with its definitive musical style has led to this 22-minute 8-second EP becoming a cult classic. Fans of <em>American Football, a picture of her,</em> and <em>Totorro,</em> will enjoy the wistful approach that <em>Clever Girl</em> took when writing this album, and though it lacks the vocals of American Football, the music still conveys a ton of emotion. When listening today, I am transported back to summer days in a friend's passenger seat, windows down, and my mind dancing along the side of the highway as <em>Clever Girl</em> plays loud enough to be heard over the wind.</p>
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; The EP opens with <em>"Elm"</em>, a song that effectively introduces the instruments that will soon become familiar friends. After a soft conversation of complementary arpeggios from the two lead guitars, the soundscape is warmed by brass tones before drums then raise the energy level. When the second act starts around 1:48 into <em>"Elm"</em>, <em>Clever Girl</em> takes the noodling up a notch as well, yet still savoring the storyline it tells the listener, leaving room for revelation and celebration in act three.</p>
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; Without spoiling it further, I encourage you to go listen to this record for yourself. And then listen to it again, and again, because this is the only goddamn album that <em>Clever Girl</em> ever made. Like all good things, <em>“No Drum and Bass in the Jazz Room”</em> ends far too soon and leaves us wanting more. The only band that has come somewhat close to emulating the magic of <em>Clever Girl</em> is <a href="https://what-nah.bandcamp.com" target="_blank"> <em>WHAT? NAH</em></a>, which is thankfully scheduled to release its own four-track EP in early 2023 after teasing us with two songs in 2020 & 2021 <a href="https://what-nah.bandcamp.com/album/scintilla>"><em>[edit July 21st: here's that EP!]</em></a>. In the meantime, please also listen to the song <a href="https://cuzcoband.bandcamp.com/track/we-miss-you-clever-girl" target="_blank"> <em>“We Miss You, Clever Girl”</em></a> by <em>Cuzco</em>, because…well, yeah.</p>

				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; Album of the year 2022: <em>Pool Kids'</em> self-titled album, <a href="https://poolkidsband.bandcamp.com/album/pool-kids" target="_blank"><em>"Pool Kids"</em></a>. I don't know why I'm even reviewing this one, since the best review out there is from Hayley Williams herself shouting out her support for the band. Listeners will notice the sonic parallels between Pool Kids and older Paramore, but Pool Kids vocalist/guitarist Christine Goodwyne and co-writer/guitarist Andrew Anaya bring more of a mathy flair to the studio. Instrumental prowess aside, Goodwyne's lyrics are emotional, relateable, and very fun to sing along to in the car. This album was an instant favorite for me, and has been  subject to many re-listens since its release.</p>
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; I almost exclusively recommend albums that are great when listened front-to-back, and this record is no exception. The band clearly took care in the arrangement of this album, with songs like <em>"Swallow"</em> leading well into <em>"Couch"</em>, and a few reverberated bits of sound flowing from the end of <em>"Couch"</em> into the start of "Waking Up". Even the album's slower songs keep the listener engaged, with "Comes In Waves" being a personal favorite (which blends into <em>"I Hope You're Right"</em>, etc.)</p>
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; <em>Pool Kids'</em> self-titled begins with a breakup, as Goodwyne belts out her goodbyes in "Councious Uncoupling". You don't need to be enduring any difficult life events to enjoy to this album, but it is always there for you when you need it. Pool Kids toned down the math in this record compared to their first (to my chagrin), but the result is a very well-rounded, and still sufficiently angsty indiemo album.</p>
				<p class="blog_entry_paragraph">&emsp; Bonus: After you listen to the Pool Kids discography, go listen to the first and only album from <em>Sweet Pill</em> and a close second place for Best Album of 2022, <a href="https://sw33tpill.bandcamp.com/album/where-the-heart-is" target="_blank"><em>"Where The Heart Is"</em></a>. While <em>Pool Kids</em> turned the math down a bit in their newest album, <em>Sweet Pill</em> keeps it going strong.</p>
