			<p> &emsp;<em><a href="https://deltasleep.bandcamp.com/album/ghost-city">"Ghost City"</a>,</em> <em>Delta Sleep's</em> second record, is an expertly crafted concept album that tells the story of a fictional yet relatable character. We find our protagonist staring at the concrete walls of her over-industrialized city, longing for the soft sounds of nature. Her story is told through lead singer Devin Yüceil's lyrics, and from the energizing intro song <em>"Sultans of Ping"</em> to the gentle outro <em>"Afterimage"</em>, this is another record that I recommend as a front-to-back listen.
			</p>
			<nbsp></nbsp>

			<p> &emsp; The protagonist's angst is made clear in the second song of the album - <em>"After Dark"</em> - where Yüceil's strained voice yells <i>"I'd give my whole world to find a way out!" </i> And while the musical elements of <em>"Ghost City"</em> are less aggressively mathy than in <em>Delta Sleep's</em> first album, <em>"Ghost City"</em> still maintains the band's recognizeable style. It's can be hard to tell where one song starts and another begins, and the whole record breathes in and out with well-placed interludes and high-energy crescendos.
			</p>
			<nbsp></nbsp>

			<p> &emsp; Lyrics like <i>"It's so hard to focus when the city watches everything you do"</i> paint the picture of a dystopian hellscape where citizens' every movement is tracked and every thought is monitored. At least we can take solace knowing that governments in the real world would never enact such far-reaching surveillance on their own residents <em>(cough cough).</em> The tone shifts later in the album, where songs like <em>"El Pastor"</em> feature more uplifting musical and vocal elements, instilling a sense of hope in the listener while moving the album's story forward.
			</p>
			<nbsp></nbsp>

			<p> &emsp; This album is like an old best friend who moved out of state - we may not see each other often these days, but when we do it's easy to pick up right where we left off. <em>"Ghost City"</em> is as emotional as it is technical, mirroring the complexities of modern life and reminding us that it's okay to close your computer and run into the woods for a while. With any luck, we will all escape The City and find home, again.

					<p> &emsp; Welcome to <a href="https://clevergirl.bandcamp.com/album/no-drum-and-bass-in-the-jazz-room" target="_blank"> <em>“No Drum and Bass in the Jazz Room”</em></a>, the perfect four-track EP. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/clevergirllovesyou" target="_blank"><em>Clever Girl</em></a> was a jazzy math rock band that released this one album before breaking up, but the band's ephemeral nature combined with its definitive musical style has led to this 22-minute 8-second EP becoming a cult classic. Fans of <em>American Football, a picture of her,</em> and <em>Totorro,</em> will enjoy the wistful approach that <em>Clever Girl</em> took when writing this album, and though it lacks the vocals of American Football, the music still conveys a ton of emotion. When listening today, I am transported back to summer days in a friend's passenger seat, windows down, and my mind dancing along the side of the highway as <em>Clever Girl</em> plays loud enough to be heard over the wind.
					</p>
					<nbsp></nbsp>

					<p> &emsp; The EP opens with <em>"Elm"</em>, a song that effectively introduces the instruments that will soon become familiar friends. After a soft conversation of complementary arpeggios from the two lead guitars, the soundscape is warmed by brass tones before drums then raise the energy level. When the second act starts around 1:48 into <em>"Elm"</em>, <em>Clever Girl</em> takes the noodling up a notch as well, yet still savoring the storyline it tells the listener, leaving room for revelation and celebration in act three.
					</p>
					<nbsp></nbsp>

					<p> &emsp; Without spoiling it further, I encourage you to go listen to this record for yourself. And then listen to it again, and again, because this is the only goddamn album that <em>Clever Girl</em> ever made. Like all good things, <em>“No Drum and Bass in the Jazz Room”</em> ends far too soon and leaves us wanting more. The only band that has come somewhat close to emulating the magic of <em>Clever Girl</em> is <a href="https://what-nah.bandcamp.com" target="_blank"> <em>WHAT? NAH</em></a>, which is thankfully scheduled to release its own four-track EP in early 2023 after teasing us with two songs in 2020 & 2021. In the meantime, please also listen to the song <a href="https://cuzcoband.bandcamp.com/track/we-miss-you-clever-girl" target="_blank"> <em>“We Miss You, Clever Girl”</em></a> by <em>Cuzco</em>, because…well, yeah.</p>

			<p> &emsp; Album of the year 2022: <em>Pool Kids'</em> self-titled album, <a href="https://poolkidsband.bandcamp.com/album/pool-kids" target="_blank"><em>"Pool Kids"</em></a>. I don't know why I'm even reviewing this one, since the best review out there is from Hayley Williams herself shouting out her support for the band. Listeners will notice the sonic parallels between Pool Kids and older Paramore, but Pool Kids vocalist/guitarist Christine Goodwyne and co-writer/guitarist Andrew Anaya bring more of a mathy flair to the studio. Instrumental prowess aside, Goodwyne's lyrics are emotional, relateable, and very fun to sing along to in the car. This album was an instant favorite for me, and has been  subject to many re-listens since its release.

			<nbsp></nbsp>

			<p> &emsp; I almost exclusively recommend albums that are great when listened front-to-back, and this record is no exception. The band clearly took care in the arrangement of this album, with songs like <em>"Swallow"</em> leading well into <em>"Couch"</em>, and a few reverberated bits of sound flowing from the end of <em>"Couch"</em> into the start of "Waking Up". Even the album's slower songs keep the listener engaged, with "Comes In Waves" being a personal favorite (which blends into <em>"I Hope You're Right"</em>, etc.)</p>

			<nbsp></nbsp>

			<p> &emsp; <em>Pool Kids'</em> self-titled begins with a breakup, as Goodwyne belts out her goodbyes in "Councious Uncoupling". You don't need to be enduring any difficult life events to enjoy to this album, but it is always there for you when you need it. Pool Kids toned down the math in this record compared to their first (to my chagrin), but the result is a very well-rounded, and still sufficiently angsty indiemo album.
			</p>

			<p> &emsp; Bonus: After you listen to the Pool Kids discography, go listem to the first and only album from <em>Sweet Pill</em> and a close second place for Best Album of 2022, <a href="https://sw33tpill.bandcamp.com/album/where-the-heart-is" target="_blank"><em>"Where The Heart Is"</em></a>. While <em>Pool Kids</em> turned the math down a bit in their newest album, <em>Sweet Pill</em> keeps it going strong.
